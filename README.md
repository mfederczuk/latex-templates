# Personal LaTeX Templates #

## About ##

This is a collection of my personal $\LaTeX$ templates that I mostly just use for school work.

## Usage ##

The [`copy-template`](copy-template) script will copy one of the templates to a specified location.

The script supports template-only comments; any comment starting with two percent signs (`%%`) will be removed when
copying.  
When an entire line is just a template-only comment, the entire line will be removed.

## License ##

Generally, the templates are published into the public domain under [**CC0**](LICENSES/CC0-1.0.txt), though different
licenses apply for individual files.  
For more information about copying and licensing, see the [`COPYING.txt`](COPYING.txt) file.
